# Learning Git and Github with VWC

## Step's *we* went through

1. Create a local repo.
  * Smart name
  * Add 2 files  index and README

2. Run command `git init`

3. Run command `git add .`

4. Go to your github account and create a new repo with the same name as my local repo.

5. Copy the repo path ie `https://github.com/volcar/vwc`

6. Add path to local git to enable pushing to remote repo.

7. Once your _local_ and _remote_ are set up with correct **username** and **password** you can add your first commit message.
  * type `git commit -m "add message here"`
  * once you are done with your commit message you're ready to make your fist push.

8. To push your first commit, type `git push origin master'

Once this is complete than you can go to your github page and check to make sure everything has been updated.
